        <!-- <p class="text-justify">Theodore Roosevelt has said, “The credit belongs to those who are actually in the arena, who strive valiantly, who know the great enthusiasm, the great devotion and spend themselves in a worthy cause ,who at the best, know the triumph of high achievement, who at the worst, if they fail, fail while daring greatly, so that their place shall never be with those cold and timid souls-who know neither victory nor defeat.”</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Being in this educational arena for more than 25 years and a witness to all the circumstances, my inspiring and innovative ideas have always proved the best and so I believe 'trust your ideas not your circumstances'.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Very best wishes for a hopeful new year. May this year bring happiness and prosperity in your lives.
